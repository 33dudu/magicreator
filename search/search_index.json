Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it\u2019s thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.</p> <p>How does it work? </p> <p>The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.</p> <p>How it\u2019s built? </p> <p>The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.</p> <p>Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore?</p> <p>The 3D printer still functions, but it\u2019s an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality.</p> <p>Steps taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Cleaned the dust off the printer and brought it to the MDEF room</p> </li> <li> <p>Disassembled using our toolbox</p> </li> <li> <p>Separated into three main parts as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The plate - Horizontal surface that also gets heated and can be moved in all directions and where the plastic is printed on;</p> </li> <li> <p>The structural part - The part that supports the entire printing machine;</p> </li> <li> <p>The extruder - Contains the motors to print 3D filament;</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Laid out all parts individually and documented.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Results</p> <p>How many motors did we find inside?</p> <p>Five motors - they are used to move the extruder in the three axis to permit drawing in 3D space.</p> <p>Does it contain a computer or microcontroller?</p> <p>Yes, an Arduino board and a RAMPS.</p> <p>Did you found any sensors?</p> <p>Yes, temperature sensors.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>What did you learn?</p> <ul> <li> <p>How a 3D printer is assembled</p> </li> <li> <p>How a 3D printer works</p> </li> <li> <p>How to power up each component individually</p> </li> <li> <p>Fundamental electronics</p> </li> <li> <p>How a step motor works</p> </li> </ul> <p>What surprised you?</p> <ul> <li> <p>The number of components, screws and pieces the printer had</p> </li> <li> <p>The fact that we can make the extruder work with just 3 components</p> </li> <li> <p>How easy and repareable it is</p> </li> <li> <p>How much the 3D technology has improved since 2015</p> </li> </ul> <p>References</p> <ul> <li>https://www.bcn3d.com/ca/arxius-open-source/</li> <li>https://reprapbcn.wordpress.com/tag/3dprinter/</li> <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ61LIdlyww</li> </ul> <p>LifeX</p> <p>Machine Outlook</p> <p> </p> <p>Bookmark Outlook</p> <p> </p> <p>At its core, LifeX uses the X-axis motor and belt system.

Into its metallic embrace, I carefully placed the remnants, opting for the outdoor drying method once again.</p> <p>Myself, serving as both creator and instrument, infused a distinctive perspective and vision into the sculpture. It highlighted the symbiotic relationship between the artist and the material, transcending the mere act of creation.</p> <p>Looking ahead, a second iteration of the waste materials beckons. This time, a new step emerges\u2014using mortar to delicately smash the eggshells. The palette expands, introducing two colors: 1. with the richness of coffee powder. 2. in its pure, unadorned form.</p> <p>As the project unfolds, it becomes more than just a sculpture; it transforms into a narrative of renewal, where discarded materials find beauty, purpose, and a second chance.

Interest During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a double major in Interior Architecture and Art History. However, my particular passion lies in Art History. I am intrigued by the origins of each art movement, the underlying logic and philosophical aspects, and the reasons leading to their eventual manifestations. Throughout my exploration of Art History, I actively traced the roots of each art movement, delving deep into their ideologies and philosophical foundations. I gained a profound understanding of how societal, cultural, and historical factors influence art movements. I sought to comprehend the origins and development of these movements from an artistic perspective, considering the unique environments and social contexts of each period. Each art movement is like a canvas saturated with the thoughts and reflections of artists of that time. I am excited by the unique creativity and ideas that emerge within these movements. Through artworks spanning different eras, I aim to understand how artists serve as cultural commentators of their times by expressing their viewpoints and emotions. While pursuing a profound understanding of art movements, my interest extends to the evolution of their ultimate forms. I believe that interpreting artworks from logical and philosophical perspectives not only aids in appreciating their aesthetics but also reveals deeper layers of thoughts and emotions embedded in these creations. In summary, my academic background fuels my deep curiosity about the origins and development of art movements.

On this trip to Barcelona, I bought my magic book at a local store called Papirvm. The store is elegant and ancient. The outer layer of this magic book is brown leather , and inside is blank white paper. The entire magic book smells like an old library, which is my favorite scent because when I was young, I used to hide in the school library warehouse and read Shakespeare\u2019s comic books (by the way, when I was young, I thought Shakespeare was a woman until I went to Shakespeare\u2019s home in England at the age of eleven and found out that he was actually a man. It\u2019s really interesting to think about this - as an Asian, I had biases about European people\u2019s hair:)). The one who sold me this notebook was an old lady, and all the notebooks in the store were handmade by them, from paper making to sewing into a book. It feels like a connection to a kind of energy, a connection to the spirit of craftsmanship. However, I don\u2019t record everything in this magic book, only specific interesting things are recorded in it. I cherish this magic book very much, and I carefully storage it into a packaging bag like a takeout bag.Each page within holds not just words but a magic; a magic connect between past, present and future.  <p>Group Narrative</p> <p>Time Lapse took by Carmen  : </p> <p> </p> <p>Handnotes took by Vania  : </p> <p></p> <p>Possible structure terms: </p> -One day\u2026 -Until\u2026 -Then\u2026 -The end\u2026 <p>Important notes:</p> you cannot use I or We. Neither me, mine, our, ourselves. Myself. So find a way to do it.  Yeah. But you need to be aware about the meaning. So, in terms of if you want to say situated glossary The meaning that you are using or creating for the journal. So it\u2019s also about speculating, such as for example with this magic machine, also the paradox. So you can use fiction as a tool to write your collective storytelling about these material experiences during these weeks. Or these material entanglements happening during weeks. Sorry, that was not the best figure. <p>Idea: </p> Everyone writes X sentences, then the next person goes and continues the collective story.  <p>The story:</p> It is funny how an accumilation of choices can lead a group of people to come together. People who a little more then a month ago were strangers have become a community working to create a better future. Little did they know that the present was gonna be the craziest challenge they ever faced.The members of the group come from diverse nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, yet collectively, they share a common experience of navigating through the intricate processes of attaining city citizenship and utilizing it to acquire a commute card amidst the challenges of bureaucratic procedures. From this primordial soup of individuals and cultures, however, some questions arise: what is really the difference between their personal and professional identities? Are they only here to work together? It seems more like these players are trying to transform their personal ideals into concrete action. The correct answer to the question doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s up to the group to embark on this new adventure and ask even more questions. Whether it\u2019s by engaging the newfound tools of the world to act on simple interactions, by analysing the enviroment lived to learn learn and learn or to by simply living in community and add up a new experience of co-living with different cultures, languages, materials, technologies, spaces, species\u2026 The journey of this eclectic assembly it\u2019s a profound exploration of self within the tapestry of a new society. As they juggle the demands of their individual lives with the collective needs, each member is crafting a unique narrative, shaped by shared struggles and triumphs. This experience may test their limits, but it also offers an opportunity to redefine their understanding of community and identity in an ever-evolving world. The shared adventure forms a community that celebrates milestones, cares for one another, and evolves into a unique system of mutual learning and support. Deep conversations about the future, technology, and all of the possibilities that lie ahead are happening everyday, and it\u2019s up to the group to use them to shape the next part of the story.It can be easy to forget, amidst the noise and haste of constant learning and unlearning, of different ways of doing, that having fun is the key. Engaging in ways of exploration and conversation that spark joy and curiosity, lies the groups hidden path to exploring the unfamiliar.This seemingly infinite and endless network, forking and merging, could, through the constant drive to challenge and prove assumptions, gather inspiring experiences for individuals who want to put themselves in this perspective of reality. This means also realizing failure during the process, an indispensable facet of the human experience.Acknowledging failure not as a dead-end but as a portal to enlightenment, one discovers the essence of resilience and adaptability, not only in learning from personal blunders but also in gleaning wisdom from the experiences of others. Failure constitutes an integral facet of the evolutionary journey. Embracing risk is essential for community advancement, and failure is an inherent component of such risks. Within the realm of uncertainty, novel discoveries await, even if accompanied by potential fear and exposure. Valuable lessons emerge from failure, offering a pathway to address topics often neglected or considered taboo. Risk-taking presents opportunities for the existence of these transformative moments shared together. In addition to learning to value failure, this group learned the power of the collective. Learning with each other means learning from one another. Individual design spaces were deeply enriched and expanded by sharing thoughts and ideas with classmates, and many assigments would have never been achieved without collaboration. If in the future one could observe the life paths followed by each of these people from this moment on. And, at the same time one could overlap the paths they would have followed if they had never met in space time.  Maybe, just maybe we would understand a little bit how this experience has shaped their lives. Between the sunrise and the sunset millions questions will shows up to the brain. by answering those question gente used the vision to noticed the informations and solutions. Vision is different in every gente. Nowdays, gente lived with technology. Also, millions creations borned. The new borned babies involved into Gente-Tech Art movement; where the dream starts to come true. Yet, in the midst of continual learning and unlearning, amidst the various approaches, it\u2019s easy to overlook that fun is essential. Participating in exploratory conversations that spark joy and curiosity unveils the group\u2019s secret journey to explore the unknown. This seemingly boundless and ever-shifting network of connections, with its twists and turns, might, by consistently challenging assumptions, accumulate enriching experiences for those who want to embrace this outlook on reality. Moreover, these diverse experiences and shared challenges of the group risk fading into memory. Documentation,is the useful source to capture the essence of their journey, preserving wisdom from failures and collective learning. It serves as a tangible record, enabling reflection, celebration of milestones, and informed shaping of the group\u2019s future. Time will tell how these group of students are going to be changed as professionals and as individual people.But always are going to have the documentation and the learning of the MDEF year This could be an opportunity to explore what it really means to have every opportunity lie ahead. To understand what it means to be one with everything and nothing in the body of a creator. To realise that every miracle once attributed to a god could also be in a group of 22 (sweetie pie) students who all crossed into one reality by making the same decision to be here.  <p>Link to the original writing board: </p> <p>Classnotes</p> <p> <p>Personal Narratives</p> <p><pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Personal] --&gt; B[Private/self];</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narrative] --&gt; B[Tell/relate];</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narration] --&gt; B[Action/telling a story];</code></pre></p> <p>Story Telling</p> <p>Act or art of relating stories</p> <p>Positive Power</p> <p>Positive/ Affirmative/Empowering = Potencia (the political) Critique as creativity</p> <p>Negative Power</p> <p>Negative/ Restrictive/ Oppressive = Potestas (the political) Politics as usual </p> <p>Planetary Scale</p> <p>Personal vs. Collective</p> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Personal] --&gt; B{Copy};\n    B --&gt;|Plus/+/| C{Paste};\n    C --&gt;|Plus/+/| D{Cut};</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Collective] --&gt; B{Copy};\n    B --&gt;|Plus/+/| C{Paste};</code></pre> <p>Narrative vs. Storytelling</p> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Narrative] \n    A --&gt;|Minus/-/| B{adj.};</code></pre> <pre><code>    graph LR\n    A[Storytelling]\n    A --&gt;|Plus/+/| B{adj.};</code></pre> <p>Problem Solver</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#we-are-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the-same","title":"We-are-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the-same","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#to-become-in-and-within-the-world","title":"To-become-in-and-with(in)-the-world","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#designer","title":"=Designer","text":""},{"location":"term1/Collective%20Stories/#artist","title":"=Artist","text":"<p>Recieving information {5 senses}</p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/","title":"DESIGN DIALOGUES","text":"<p>PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE</p> <p>FACULTY: Guillem Camprodon/ Tomas Diez/ Laura Benitez/Jana Tothill Calvo/ Roger Guilemany/ Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Josep Marti Elias/ Petra Garajov\u00e1/ Adai Surinach</p> <p>CALENDAR: 11/12/2023 - 19/12/2023</p> <p>TRACK: \u201c\u201dSHOWTIME\u201d\u201c</p> <p>KEYWORD: \u201c7 SINS/ ART THERAPY/ WASTES/ EDUCATION\u201d</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/#now-its-our-time-to-shine","title":"NOW, it\u2019s our-time to SHINE","text":"<p>Poster</p> <p>"},{"location":"term1/Design%20Dialogues/#comments-box-for-pastpresentfuture","title":"Comments box for  Past/Present/Future","text":"<p> <p></p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>The comments paper was a side waste collected from a print shop ( IMPRESI\u00d3N, DISE\u00d1O Y COLOR,  Carrer de Fluvi\u00e0, 217, BAJOS, Sant Mart\u00ed, 08020 Barcelona )</p> </li> <li> <p>The comment container was a waste water bottle.</p> <p>I got a lots of comments/feedback/debates: From MANY AMAZING PEOPLE BIG LOVE BIG THANKS  </p> </li> </ul> <p>GOAL</p> <p>Dialogue is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people.

However, during my conversation with Tomas, he pointed out a crucial issue. Subsequently, I introspected and identified my weak point, which turned out to be technology.</p> <p>In an effort to address this, I explored the MDEF classroom and sought out abandoned machines that resonated with me. Ultimately, I settled on an old 80s TV. My goal was to connect it to my iPhone 14 Plus. After several attempts and searches, I succeeded.

Let me give a try to solve this bug.  <p>BUG: How to solve the trash and either make it to a functional or aesthetic. To let the Pretty &amp; Ugly to stay at a balance. </p> <p>It was nice to have the winter break spent in Jamaica. It helped me enlarge my perspective on seeing the world and rethink about the environment and waste. Several weak signals in Jamaica:</p> <p>Waste Management Observations:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The understanding of waste/trash is different compared to the city:</p> <ul> <li>For example, people in the city will throw the garbage into the trash can, and the trash company will help us deal with that waste. But people in Jamaica, who live in nature, will burn the trash/garbage. So, considering the pollution or health situation from burning plastic just right next to you while playing dominoes or swimming in the river.</li> <li>Also, the age of the trash: People living in the city will throw away new plastic or trash immediately after they finish using it. But people I met in Jamaica will reuse the waste.</li> <li>(Can we design a machine that can dissolve and break down the waste in the local neighborhood and print it as a new usable thing?)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The ecosystem is amazing in Jamaica, its the gift from the sky, so when I saw a garbage mountain in the middle of amazing envirnoment, my heart start break down. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Noise Pollution from Sound Systems:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A good point from Jamaican teenager Chris: The issue of sound pollution from sound systems.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Impact on Community Well-being: The Jamaican teenager mention of sound systems and noise pollution highlights a potential environmental concern. Balancing the cultural significance of events with the well-being of local communities is crucial.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Lack of technological skills</p> <ul> <li> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but notice the genuine curiosity people have about technology. It\u2019s amusing that whenever someone saw my phone, the first question was always, \u201cWhich iPhone is this?\u201d Despite this interest, there\u2019s a twist \u2013 many locals face a challenge as they lack both knowledge and financial means to actively engage in societal activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s interesting to witness the excitement people have for modern gadgets, especially iPhones. However, the reality is that not everyone can fully dive into technology due to limited resources and knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mix of curiosity and limited access to information and financial resources creates a unique situation. There\u2019s interest, yet the pace of life seems laid-back, possibly because not everyone can fully participate in the digital world.</p> </li> <li> <p>My experience in Jamaica raises questions about the connection between technology, knowledge, and socioeconomic factors. How can we bridge the gap and empower communities to be more actively involved in the digital age? Initiatives focusing on digital literacy or making technology more accessible could play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and engaged society.</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bali</li> </ul> <p>2.

Initially, I grappled with the challenges of unstable mental health, but delving into the worlds of art history and psychology changed my perspective.</p> <p>Studying these subjects allowed me to form a deep connection with myself. Rather than viewing my emotional challenges negatively, I embraced them as allies in my creative process. The profound feelings that once troubled me have now become the driving force behind my artistic expression.</p> <p>Through art, I\u2019ve found a beautiful way to befriend myself. Every stroke on the canvas becomes a release, and the emotional richness infuses my work with authenticity. It\u2019s not just about stabilizing my mental well-being; it\u2019s about turning vulnerability into strength.</p> <p>This fusion of emotional exploration and artistic expression has become a privilege \u2014 a source of inspiration that allows me to create art that is not only visually striking but also deeply meaningful. In embracing the tumultuous waves of my emotions, I\u2019ve discovered the power of turning personal challenges into a canvas of beauty and resilience.</p> <p>GOOD_POINTS</p> <pre><code>graph LR\nA{Student/ Teacher} --&gt; B{Participants/ Peers};</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>When we say machines learning, lets say collaborative learning. </p> </li> <li> <p>We * are (in) the \u201creal world\u201d(s).</p> </li> <li> <p>But we will create together a safe space to reimagine them. </p> </li> <li>Positionality Statements:</li> <li>Source: Don\u2019t Mention the Emergency?(2018)</li> <li>Designing in a state of climate emergency the Polycrisis</li> <li>How novel is the Polycrisis</li> <li>Human energy consumption</li> <li>Human population\u2019s total biomass</li> <li>Earth\u2019s energy balance</li> <li>Connectivity of human population</li> <li>Kimberle Crenshaw</li> <li>The everything Manifesto (Pale blue Dot(1990)- Voyager 1)</li> <li>Solar Centered Designing</li> <li>Ignoring a shared sense of time</li> <li>Silicon Valley is Truning into its own worst fear- BuzzFeedNews</li> <li>Socioethical impact: </li> <li>Ecosocial impact:</li> <li>Humbleness- Humans </li> <li>Book: Meeting the Universe Halfway- Dr. Karen Barad</li> <li>Words shape worlds. Film: Metropolis(1927)</li> </ol> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>\u201cMetropolis\u201d is a German expressionist science-fiction film directed by Fritz Lang. It was released in 1927 and is considered one of the pioneering works of the science fiction genre in cinema. Here are some key points about the film:</p> <p>Director: Fritz Lang</p> <p>Release Date: January 10, 1927</p> <p>Genre: Science Fiction, Dystopian</p> <p>Plot Summary: \u201cMetropolis\u201d is set in a futuristic dystopian city divided into two classes: the wealthy elite who live in luxurious skyscrapers above ground, and the oppressed working class who toil in harsh conditions below ground. The city is governed by Joh Fredersen, who oversees the construction of a massive skyscraper called the \u201cNew Tower of Babel.\u201d The protagonist, Freder, is the son of Joh Fredersen. When he discovers the plight of the workers, he becomes determined to bridge the gap between the classes.</p> <p>The film explores themes of class struggle, industrialization, and the consequences of unchecked technological progress. It also features a humanoid robot called Maria, created by the inventor Rotwang, who becomes a central figure in the narrative.</p> <p>Influence and Legacy: \u201cMetropolis\u201d is celebrated for its groundbreaking special effects, innovative set design, and iconic imagery. The film\u2019s visual style, characterized by elaborate and monumental sets, has left a lasting impact on the science fiction genre and cinema as a whole.</p> <p>Despite its initial critical and commercial challenges, \u201cMetropolis\u201d has since gained recognition as a classic and influential film. Various restored versions have been released over the years, and it continues to be studied and appreciated for its cinematic achievements and its thematic exploration of societal issues.</p> <p>The film\u2019s influence can be seen in later science fiction works, including Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and many other dystopian films that explore the consequences of a divided society. \u201cMetropolis\u201d remains a significant part of film history, showcasing the artistic and storytelling possibilities of the medium.</p> <p>Gold-points</p> <p> <p>By: Ana Lozano/ Carmen Veciana/ N\u00faria Valsells/ Qianyin Du/ Oliver Lloyd</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term2/02-%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#things-about-critical-data-center-studies","title":"things about Critical Data Center studies","text":"<ol> <li>Earths</li> <li> <p>Water</p> <ul> <li>Water and microchips: the climatic and industrial future of Taiwan</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Labor</p> </li> <li> <p>Energy</p> </li> <li> <p>Heat</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"term2/02-%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#what-is-your-3-key-takeaways","title":"What is your 3 key takeaways?","text":"<ol> <li> <p>When we say machines learning, lets say collaborative learning </p> </li> <li> <p>The end of the capitalism?</p> </li> <li>Do you know where your shit goes?</li> </ol> <p>Spring Team </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>we are no longer people we are user</li> </ul> <p>Date: 2024/01/10</p> <p>"},{"location":"term2/02-%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#time","title":"TIME","text":"<p>GOOD_POINTS</p> <ol> <li> <p>RECURRENT  NON-RECURRENT</p> </li> <li> <p>Time is the measure of change </p> </li> <li> <p>Calender</p> </li> <li> <p>ZEITGEIST- Spirit of the time</p> </li> <li> <p>ZEITGEBER- Donor of the time</p> </li> <li> <p>Residual time: codes, languages, and behaviors already misaligned</p> </li> <li>Dominant time: codes defining the reality around us. </li> <li>Emergent time: evidences of new narratives shaping culture.</li> <li> <p>Spirit of the time: ontological perspectivs interacting.</p> </li> <li> <p>The currency of our time is no longer money but time itself</p> </li> <li> <p>It was the clock and not the steam engine the defining machine of the modern industrial era\u201d- MUMFORD LEWIS</p> </li> <li> <p>Histmap</p> </li> <li> <p>| CHTULUCENE | | CORPORATIVOCENE| | ANTROPOCENE |</p> </li> </ol> <p>The fact is more truth on the land then the page</p> <p>References</p> <p>https://theteknologist.wordpress.com/2020/11/08/what-is-ubuntu-and-why-we-need-it/</p> <p>Date: 2024/01/11</p> <p> Thank you ChatMA, my peer~for sharing me her notes of the first half class</p> <p>Three key question suggested from Andres</p> <ol> <li> <p>Suffiences</p> <ul> <li>To having an adequate amount of something, being self-sufficient or having enough resources.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Consumption (efficient use of resources) &amp; Production (generating enough resources)</p> </li> <li> <p>FairyTale from the Nation/ the Country/ the States</p> </li> </ol> <p>References</p> <p>2014 Forum on Ethics &amp; Nature: Robin Kimmerer</p> <p>The Secret to Talking about Climate Change</p> <p>"},{"location":"term2/02-%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#how-to-separate-economic-growth-from-its-negative-impacts-on-the-environment","title":"How to separate economic growth from its negative impacts on the environment?","text":"<p>The goal is to keep the economy growing while reducing its harmful effects on the planet.

Let me give a try to solve this bug.  <p>BUG: How to solve the trash and either make it to a functional or aesthetic. To let the Pretty &amp; Ugly to stay at a balance. </p>  <p>It was nice to have the winter break spent in Jamaica. It helped me enlarge my perspective on seeing the world and rethink about the environment and waste. Several weak signals in Jamaica:</p>  <p>Waste Management Observations:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The understanding of waste/trash is different compared to the city:</p> <ul> <li>For example, people in the city will throw the garbage into the trash can, and the trash company will help us deal with that waste. But people in Jamaica, who live in nature, will burn the trash/garbage. So, considering the pollution or health situation from burning plastic just right next to you while playing dominoes or swimming in the river.</li> <li>Also, the age of the trash: People living in the city will throw away new plastic or trash immediately after they finish using it. But people I met in Jamaica will reuse the waste.</li> <li>(Can we design a machine that can dissolve and break down the waste in the local neighborhood and print it as a new usable thing?)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The ecosystem is amazing in Jamaica, its the gift from the sky, so when I saw a garbage mountain in the middle of amazing envirnoment, my heart start break down. </p> </li> </ol> <p>Noise Pollution from Sound Systems:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A good point from Jamaican teenager Chris: The issue of sound pollution from sound systems.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Impact on Community Well-being: The Jamaican teenager mention of sound systems and noise pollution highlights a potential environmental concern. Balancing the cultural significance of events with the well-being of local communities is crucial.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Lack of technological skills</p> <ul> <li> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but notice the genuine curiosity people have about technology. It\u2019s amusing that whenever someone saw my phone, the first question was always, \u201cWhich iPhone is this?\u201d Despite this interest, there\u2019s a twist \u2013 many locals face a challenge as they lack both knowledge and financial means to actively engage in societal activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s interesting to witness the excitement people have for modern gadgets, especially iPhones. However, the reality is that not everyone can fully dive into technology due to limited resources and knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>The mix of curiosity and limited access to information and financial resources creates a unique situation. There\u2019s interest, yet the pace of life seems laid-back, possibly because not everyone can fully participate in the digital world.</p> </li> <li> <p>My experience in Jamaica raises questions about the connection between technology, knowledge, and socioeconomic factors. How can we bridge the gap and empower communities to be more actively involved in the digital age? Initiatives focusing on digital literacy or making technology more accessible could play a significant role in creating a more inclusive and engaged society.</p> </li> </ul>    <p>","text":""},{"location":"term2/02-%20Designing%20in%20a%20State%20of%20Climate%20Emergency/#what-is-world","title":"What is WORLD","text":"<p>From my perspective YIN&amp;YANG would be the best word to describe the WORLD.

In doing so, we are helping locals solve their waste and money problems.

Those born in the Year of the Dragon are believed to inherit these qualities, making it an auspicious sign associated with success, prosperity, and royal status. The dragon is also considered a guardian spirit against evil influences. In Chinese culture, dragon dances and imagery are used to bring good luck during celebrations. Individuals born in the Year of the Dragon are associated with independence, ambition, and natural leadership.

During this whole week, time went by so fast. With two people in a group, we had a lot to learn, and our time management and workflow separation needed improvement. This time, we mainly focused on the electronic components. We did not leave enough time for the facade design, and the electronic component connections were a huge challenge for us. Since we were trying to create a wearable item for the ear, we needed to ensure everything was small, so we spent a lot of time on soldering. In the end, we realized that the soldering station is extremely important, and having a third hand is essential for soldering. I loved this micro challenge even though it was super intense, but I learned a lot from it.</p> <p>References:</p> <p>Ear Cuff Sizing</p> <p>Geometry</p> <p>Hybridbodylab</p> <p>Burton Nitta</p>"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenge%20II/","title":"MICRO CHALLENGE II","text":"<p>Challenge II Digital Prototying for Design</p> <p>FACULTY: Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Oscar Gonzalez/ Josep Marti Elias/ Petra Garajov\u00e1/ Adai Surinach</p> <p>CALENDAR: 14/03/2024 </p> <p>TRACK: Application</p> <p>TEAM: Windows XP [Ana Lozano, Everdardo Castro Torres, Nicol\u00f2 Baldi, Qianyin Du]</p> <p>Quote</p> <p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenge%20II/#challenge-ii","title":"Challenge II","text":""},{"location":"term2/Micro%20Challenge%20II/#green-is-the-new-red","title":"GREEN IS THE NEW RED\ud83d\udc7d     <p>Personal Reflection</p>  <p>During micro Challenge II we had four people in the group, so we had more advantages and could accomplish more in one week.

When you approach a mimosa, it naturally gives you a warning or signal, which is undoubtedly a display of natural wisdom. We have infused this wisdom into \u2018Gaia\u2019 as well.

In other words, as technology improves and makes it more efficient to use a resource, the total consumption of that resource may actually rise rather than fall, because the lowered cost or increased availability encourages greater use.

They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and functions, catering to different preferences and desires. Some common types of sex toys include vibrators, dildos, anal plugs, masturbators, bondage gear, and sensory stimulation tools like feathers or blindfolds. People use sex toys for solo play, as well as with partners, to explore their bodies, enhance arousal, and add variety to sexual experiences.</p> <p> What is Vibrator?</p> <p>A vibrator, sometimes described as a massager, is a sex toy that is used on the body to produce pleasurable sexual stimulation. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Explore the Mediation of Experience phenomenologically:</p> <p>Analyze how the artefact mediates human actions nad perceptions. Consider how it changes the way users perceive, and engage with the world.</p> <p>Vibrators</p> <p>A vibrator mediates human actions and perceptions primarily by transforming sensory experiences and intimate interactions. Phenomenologically, this device changes the way users perceive and engage with their own bodies and potentially with partners. It enhances sensory experiences, providing a new form of pleasure that may not be achievable through traditional means. It also alters users\u2019 understanding of sexual fulfillment and intimacy, potentially expanding their perception of pleasure beyond physical interaction to include technological facilitation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identify one or more relevant Human- Technology Relations:</p> <p>2.1. embodiment</p> <p>The vibrator acts as an extension of the body\u2019s sensory capabilities. Users often view it as part of their intimate experiences, facilitating a personal connection that is physically external yet experientially integrated.</p> <p>2.2. hermeneutic</p> <p>The vibrator serves as a medium through which individuals interpret and understand sensations differently. It mediates the experience of pleasure, offering a new \u2018language\u2019 or means of decoding bodily feelings.</p> <p>2.3. alterity</p> <p>The device can be seen as an \u2018other\u2019 in the context of personal or shared intimate experiences. It plays a distinct role in the sexual act, separate from human partners, often introducing a new dynamic to relationships and self-exploration.</p> <p>2.4. background</p> <p>Vibrators operate in the background of societal discussions about sexuality, often influencing norms and expectations quietly. Their presence and use reflect and can shift cultural understandings and taboos surrounding sexual wellness.</p> <p>It may require 2 human ??? in this situation??</p> <p>2.5. cyborg</p> <p>In a broader interpretation, regular use of a vibrator can lead to a cyborg-like relationship where human sexual experience and response are intertwined with technology, affecting how pleasure is experienced and expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Analyse the mediation of experience ethically:</p> <p>Explore any moral or ethical dimensions the artefact mediates. COnsider how it shapes human actions, decisions, and ethical considerations. What balues are inscribed and excluded in the artefact.</p> <p>The ethical dimensions of vibrator use include considerations of privacy, autonomy, and the normalization of sexual wellness tools. These devices can empower users by providing control over their sexual experiences and pleasure, promoting a sense of autonomy and self-awareness. However, they also raise questions about dependency, the potential for isolation from human intimacy, and the commodification of personal pleasure. Moreover, the design and marketing of vibrators can reflect and perpetuate certain body images and sexual standards, potentially marginalizing non-normative sexual expressions and identities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contextualize in Society</p> <p>Discuss the broader societal implications of the artefact\u2019s mediation. Consider cultural, social, and possibly political dimensions of its use and integration into daily life short-term and long-term. What wil or could change?</p> <p>Vibrators have played a significant role in the destigmatization of female sexuality and masturbation. They are increasingly discussed in the context of health and well-being rather than solely in moral or hedonistic terms. Socially, their acceptance speaks to broader shifts toward individual liberty and the recognition of sexual health as part of overall well-being.</p> </li> <li> <p>Summarize three key points of yur analysise and present. </p> <p>In summary, vibrators mediate human experiences by enhancing sensory perception, providing new modalities for pleasure, and challenging traditional norms around sexuality. They embody complex relationships between humans and technology, reflecting broader societal shifts towards acceptance and understanding of sexual wellness. Ethically, they promote autonomy but also raise questions about the implications of technological dependency in intimate areas of life. Vibrators, therefore, are not just personal pleasure devices but are significant artefacts with profound societal\u00a0implications.</p> <ul> <li>Self cleaning system \ud83d\ude43</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Reference</p> <p>What is Sex Toys</p> <p>Wiki-Vibrator</p>"},{"location":"term3/03-%20Design%20Ethics/#1-technological-neutrality","title":"1.

The background depicts the tuned mass damper sphere within Taipei 101. It\u2019s a crucial technology that helps balance the building\u2019s height and mitigate the impact of wind forces, especially in tall structures. The creation of this card coincided with Taiwan experiencing a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, prompting me to contemplate further. Through this natural disaster, we delve deeper into considering the balance between the realities and virtual realities of today\u2019s society. While an earthquake may be merely a fantasy in the virtual world, it\u2019s an inevitable disaster in reality. Therefore, this card aims to awaken people\u2019s climate consciousness and spark reflection on the balance between humanity and technology.</p> <p>In the era of WEB 3.0 &amp; 4.0, maintaining a balance between humanity and technology is paramount. Some argue that machine rights should not surpass those of humans. For example, in the real world, people may feel lost without technology, and time serves as a prime illustration. Only through technology, such as electronic screens, do people become aware of the existence of time, which might simply be a series of numbers. Therefore, we need to recognize that while technology brings convenience, we also need to strike a balance between humanity and technology to avoid losing touch with the real world.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Reference</p> <p>Taiwan 101tunned mass damper</p>"},{"location":"term3/07-%20MDEFest%202024/","title":"MDEFest 2024","text":"<p>HAPPENING</p> <p>MDEFest 2024</p> <p>FACULTY: Laura Benitez|Bani Brusadin|Manuela Reyes|Jana Tothill Calvo</p> <p>CALENDAR: 08/04|15/04|22/04|29/04|2024</p> <p>TRACK: Exploration</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Notes</p> <p>Pad</p> <p>Activity</p> <p></p> <p>Reference</p>"},{"location":"term3/07-%20MDEFest%202024/#in-progress","title":"IN PROGRESS","text":""},{"location":"term3/07-%20MDEFest%202024/#in-progress_1","title":"IN PROGRESS\ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f","text":""},{"location":"term3/07-%20MDEFest%202024/#in-progress_2","title":"IN PROGRESS\ud83e\uddd0","text":""},{"location":"term3/Micro%20Challenge%20III/","title":"MICRO CHALLENGE III","text":"<p>Micro Challenge III</p> <p>FACULTY: Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Pure Gold Workshop</p> <p>CALENDAR: 07/05/2024- 10/05/2024 </p> <p>TRACK: Application</p> <p>Teammate: Minnie</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>"},{"location":"term3/Micro%20Challenge%20III/#fablab-class-docs","title":"\ud83e\udd16FabLab Class Docs.","text":""},{"location":"term3/Micro%20Challenge%20III/#topdown-bottomup","title":"\ud83e\uddf2\u269b\ufe0f TOP\u2013down | BOTTOM\u2013up \u269b\ufe0f\ud83e\uddf2","text":"<p>33</p> <p>Stop-motion video</p> <p>Coming soon~\ud83d\udc8c</p> <p>Trash-baby 33</p> <p> <p> <p> <p>For future</p> <p>During the presentation, I received many useful feedback. One particularly interesting comment was about the appeal of the sounds produced by the [33]. These sounds, generated by the servo motor, were well-received, especially when combined with the egg carton facade, which provided effective acoustic insulation to prevent them from becoming annoying. Another point raised was the desire for enhanced interactivity, particularly in relation to the opening and closing movements of the trash, symbolizing the breathing process, and the interaction of light with these movements. The future goal is to create a more immersive experience, making the coral\u2019s breathing feel more authentic and lifelike.</p> <p>Process</p> <p> Area of interest  <p></p> <p>Interaction Description</p> <p>\u201cThis project combines a PIR motion sensor, an LED strip, and a continuous rotation servo motor controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The PIR sensor detects motion, triggering the LED strip to illuminate in yellow when motion is detected and purple when there is no motion. Simultaneously, the servo motor controls the movement of a \u2018tra$h coral\u2019, symbolizing the rebirth of discarded items. The servo motor opens and closes the \u2018trash flower\u2019 in response to motion, creating an interactive and visually captivating experience.

The Pure Gold workshop is a four-day full-day immersive experience. By using trash to rethink and redesign it for upcycling, aimed to achieve the goal of top-down, bottom-up sustainability. During the four days of the workshop, I learned a lot. I questioned myself: what makes a good designer? Am I creating a new art installation or am I simply producing more trash? As the workshop concluded, I left with a renewed perspective on design and a commitment to continue exploring innovative ways to repurpose materials and create meaningful, sustainable art. Additionally, through interactive art, I solidified my goal of incorporating technology and intelligence to bring the tra$h to life.  \ud83d\udc9b</p> <p>YOU GOT THIS -O-</p> <p>BREADBOARD</p> <p>Electric potential</p> <p>What is ohm?</p> <p>SR501</p> <p>https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@cha0s0000/arduino-hc-sr501-led</p>"},{"location":"term3/Micro%20Challenge%20III/#intro","title":"INTRO:","text":""},{"location":"term3/Micro%20Challenge%20III/#puregold","title":"PureGold\ud83d\udc48","text":""},{"location":"term3/Task03/","title":"TASK03","text":"<p>Task 03 Digital Prototying for Design</p> <p>FACULTY: Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Adai Surinach/ Josep Marti Elias</p> <p>CALENDAR: 22/02/2024 </p> <p>TRACK: Application</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>"},{"location":"term3/Task03/#task03","title":"\ud83e\udd16 TASK03","text":""},{"location":"term3/Task03/#measure-twice-cut-once","title":"Measure TWICE; Cut ONCE\ud83e\udd78","text":"<p>Process</p> <p>Sketch </p> <p> </p> <p>Prepared the Rhino file</p> <p> </p> <p>Prepared the G-code</p> <p>Github</p> <p>G-code github link</p> <p>Let the machine do the work</p> <p> <p> </p> <p>Sanding</p> <p> </p> <p>Oil protect </p> <p>How to waterproof-plywood</p> <p>Final result</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"term3/Task04/","title":"TASK04","text":"<p>Task 04 Digital Prototying for Design</p> <p>FACULTY: Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga/ Citlali Hern\u00e1ndez/ Gerard Valls</p> <p>CALENDAR: 19/04/2024 </p> <p>TRACK: Application</p> <p>Notes</p> <p>\u231bModule 4: 23/04/2024</p> <p> What is the body</p> <ul> <li>mediumm or tool for expression</li> <li>topic to research</li> </ul> <p>The body {(individual);(politic);(social);}</p> <p>24/04/2024</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    A[Physical] --&gt; B{Digital};\n    B --&gt; C{Fabricating};\n    C --&gt; D{Soft senor};\n    D --&gt; E{Programming};</code></pre> <ul> <li>from Physical to Digital </li> <li>fabricating </li> <li>soft sensor </li> <li>programming</li> </ul> <p>HCI: human computer interaction</p> <p>Sketchpad, 1963 | Ivan Sutherland</p> <p>How does an interaction happen?</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    A[INput: Gesture, Movement, Action] --&gt; B{Mapping: And data processing};\n    B --&gt; C{OUTput: Light, Mechanisms, Sound, ETC};</code></pre> <p>Emotion Detection</p> <ol> <li> <p>Vision Based Techniques:</p> <ul> <li>Speech Recognition</li> <li>Facial Recognition</li> <li>Gait Recognition (how we walk)</li> <li>Gaze Recognition (how we look)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Physiological data signal analysis:</p> <ul> <li>EEG (Electroenceohalogram): measures electrical activity in the brain</li> <li>ECG (Electrocardiogram): records the electrical signals in the heart</li> <li>EMG (Electromygram): muscle movement control</li> <li>GSR (Galvanic Skin Response): electrical changes in the skin caused by sweat gland activity</li> <li>RSP (Respiration ):measuring the physical change of the thoracic expansion with a rubber band around the chest or belly</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Emotion Detection &amp; Machine Learning</p> <p> What a Machine Learning System is and needs:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Data sets</p> </li> <li> <p>Algorithms (Neural nets, Markov Chains, etc\u2026)</p> </li> <li> <p>Models (trained)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>WEKINATOR</p> <p>Good experienced</p> <p>Playing around with Wekinator, I wish we can have more time to playaround with it. </p> <p></p> <p>Reference</p> <p>Atlas of emotions</p> <p>the machine is leaning-Marije Baalman</p> <p>How to get what you want</p> <p>The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing</p>"},{"location":"term3/Task04/#task04","title":"TASK04","text":""},{"location":"term3/Task04/#1-what-is-wekinator","title":"1.
